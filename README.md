# 📈 Time Series Seasonality

This project focuses on analyzing and extracting seasonality patterns from monthly sales data using time series decomposition techniques. It includes data trimming, exploratory visualizations, and saving the seasonal components for business insights and forecasting use.

## 💡 Background  
While building MMM models at work, seasonality for sales was always calculated in the backend with just a single click. I was curious to understand how it works behind the scenes — that curiosity led me to research time series decomposition and the statistical methods involved. Eventually, I put them together into this **simple and reusable Seasonality Calculator**  — a project I’m proud to share.

## 🔁 Project Steps

### 1. Input Data
- Load monthly (or) quartertly sales data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Convert the `Period` column to a datetime format and set it as the index for time series operations.

### 2. Trim the Dataset
- Use `start_point` and `end_point` to remove rows from the beginning or end if needed.

### 3. Visualization & Analysis
- Plot line charts to observe sales trends.
- Add a 3-month rolling mean to smooth out fluctuations and compare it with original sales plot.
- Visualize distributions using boxplot.

### 4. Seasonality Calculation
- Use `seasonal_decompose` (additive model, period = 12 for monthly data) to extract:
  - **Trend**
  - **Seasonal component**
  - **Residuals**

### 5. Saving Output
- Convert the seasonal component (a pandas Series) into a DataFrame.
- Save it as a CSV file using `to_csv()`.
